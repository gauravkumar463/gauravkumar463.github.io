        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Gaurav Kumar, an Aerospace Engineer with a specialization in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Data Science. Currently I am working on solution/data driven methods to accelerate the traditional CFD tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hold a B.Tech-M.Tech Dual degree (2011-2016) and Ph.D. (2016-2021) from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. Following my doctoral studies, I spent two enriching years as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore from 2021 to 2023. My research during this period focused on combining experiments and numerical simulations to understand aeroacoustics in high speed flow with large separation bubble. Currently, I am continuing my academic journey as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Nevada, Reno, since March 2023. Here, I am engaged in cutting-edge research on accelerating traditional computational tools (which are mathematically rigourous but not fast) with data-driven techniques (which are fast but lack mathematical understanding in many areas).
        </p>
        <p>
            With a passion for advancing scientific knowledge and solving complex problems, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the intersection of computational science and data science. My journey in research has been marked by dedication, curiosity, and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of knowledge.
        </p>

            Thank you for visiting my personal homepage, where I share insights into my academic and professional journey. Feel free to explore my research at <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=CGKSHlUAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>, and don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or collaborative opportunities.

        <h2 style="padding-top:5%; padding-left:2%;"> Updates </h2>
        <p>I have developed a compressible flow solver in OpenFOAM (try out the code from <a href="https://github.com/gauravkumar463/rhoLDFSSFoam">here</a>) which is stable, accurate, and fast. There is also a gpu version of the code available <a href="https://github.com/gauravkumar463/rhoLDFSSFoam_gpu">here</a>.</p>

        <p> I have recently started a lecture series called <a href="https://gauravkumar463.notion.site/gauravkumar463/Thursday-CFD-series-241ee62d80f142a6bc7fea27cb445d02" target="_blank"><i> Thursday CFD series</i> </a> where I talk about numerical methods, CFD and OpenFOAM CFD toolbox in my research group. I intend to collect my lecture notes from these discussions in the above blog. If you like my blog or want to have a conversation about the above topic, do reach out to me via email. </p>
